# Passwords
- a password manager https://www.passwordstore.org/ 
- pwgen generates random, meaningless but pronounceable passwords.
 These passwords contain either only lowercase letters, or upper
 and lower case mixed, or digits thrown in.
 Uppercase letters and digits are placed in a way that eases
 remembering their position when memorizing only the word.
 sudo apt-get install pwgen
 https://8-p.info/pwgen/
 - Password Strength https://xkcd.com/936/

# Linux
- needrestart checks which daemons need to be restarted after library upgrades.
 It is inspired by checkrestart from the debian-goodies package.
 sudo apt-get install needrestart
 - use systemd timers rather than the more familiar to me cron jobs. https://web.archive.org/web/20180824211406/https://jason.the-graham.com/2013/03/06/how-to-use-systemd-timers/
